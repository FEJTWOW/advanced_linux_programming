# Advanced linux programming

These programms were created just for academic purpouse. All of them cover topic from the book [The Linux Programming Interface](https://man7.org/tlpi/).

## Content

- various clocks avaliable in linux
- timers
- process communication with pipes and fifo
- experiments with lseek and file holes
- signaling in linux
- data multiplexing 
- sequential server  

If you want to compile some of them just type

```sh
cmake .
make
```

One of these programs helps me to find an issue under linux kernel which can be tracked here [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65814946/timer-disarms-when-interval-is-too-small).
